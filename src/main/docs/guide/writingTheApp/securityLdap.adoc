Micronaut supports authentication with LDAP out of the box. To get started, add the `security-ldap` dependency to your application.

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
...
..
.
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=security-ldap]
}
----

We are going to use an https://www.forumsys.com/tutorials/integration-how-to/ldap/online-ldap-test-server/[Online LDAP test server] for this guide.

Create several configuration properties matching those of the test LDAP Server.

[source,yaml]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
micronaut:

  .
  security:

include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/application.yml[tag=ldap]
